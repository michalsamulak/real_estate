Real Estate Website is a website where you can browse and search for properties, as well as list your own property for sale. In this project, I utilized the following technologies:

## Tool & technologies I've used

- Firebase Storage

## App functionalities
Real Estate Website includes several functionalities, such as:

Sign up and login using Firebase Authentication
Browse properties by searching and filtering by title, price, and other features
View detailed information about each property, including images, title, description, location, and contact information for the seller
Add new properties for sale by filling out a form, including upload images
Edit and delete properties that you have listed for sale
View a dashboard with all properties that you have listed for sale

## How to use it

```
